In the previous section I learned.

1. install the nextjs  -- actrually already known.
2. css styling -- not very difficult just change the className almost old knowledge.
3. Optimizing Fonts and Images -- have no idea about how fonts works before. good to learn. Image interesting but not quite understand 'md:block' meaning. This should be something from tailwind?
4. Good to know how pages and layout works. One question that are there any other special file names in this system.
5. Links, this is a bit boring. Preload may not be cheap and mix the client and serverside rendering makes me feel not so good. Overall replace every `a` to `Link` 
6. setting up the database. It is good, one stop host. And if it became more expansive. Just leave. The only short point might be the low network went testing. (so local test is important)
7. It is good but also amuzed me at the same time. I have no clear idea what is in build time and what are not.
8. this is cool. we can control the render process. So now next can be a server?
9. Streaming is good to control the render process.
10. just read
11. learn how to control the url path and search params. However server side search might not be so good to me.

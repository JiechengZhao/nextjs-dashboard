In the previous section I learned.

1. install the nextjs  -- actrually already known.
2. css styling -- not very difficult just change the className almost old knowledge.
3. Optimizing Fonts and Images -- have no idea about how fonts works before. good to learn. Image interesting but not quite understand 'md:block' meaning. This should be something from tailwind?
4. Good to know how pages and layout works. One question that are there any other special file names in this system.
5. Links, this is a bit boring. Preload may not be cheap and mix the client and serverside rendering makes me feel not so good. Overall replace every `a` to `Link`
